<h1>Automatization of microbial cultures in deepwell plates for strain characterization</h1>
<p>This project was supervised by Mauricio Garcia Benitez of the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry.
During the Winter 2023 semester, myself and three other undergraduates conducted this study as part of the STEM Fellowship's Indicium Program. 
We presented our work at the UTSG campus level competition where we placed first. For this, we were selected to participate in the National Indicium conference, where we ranked third of ten teams. 
For placing in the top three of teams at the conference, our manuscript will be published in the STEM Fellowship's peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>You can read the (pre-print) manuscript <a href="automation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can access the data <a href="INDICIUM2023_DATA.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, further details are available under the <a href="https://github.com/dumassam">GitHub</a> repository.</p>
