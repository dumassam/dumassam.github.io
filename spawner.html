<h1>Spawner-recruit modelling of salmon population dynamics.</h1>
<p>This project is supervised by Dr. Marty Krkosek of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>During the 2024-2025 academic year, I am joining the Krkosek lab to explore the utilization of spawner-recruit models for salmon population dynamics. 
This project is being conducted alongside the Lewis Research Group of the University of Victoria.
