<h1>MAT188 - Course Development</h>
<p style="white-space: pre-line;">Project supervised by Dr. Camelia Karimianpour

Since 2022, I have worked closely with Dr. Camelia Karimianpour (Course Coordinator) to improve the course MAT188: Linear Algebra for Engineers, at the University of Toronto. The primary objective of my work was to develop LaTeX packages to store a database of mathematical theorems, learning standards, and tutorial questions which could later be pulled to create course documents. Using these packages, we sought to provide students with Post-Class Essentials (PCEs) and a standard-based grading approach for some course components. Recent efforts within this project have utilized student-collected data to determine the effectiveness of PCEs as a replacement for standard textbooks and the incorporation of standards-based grading.</p>
