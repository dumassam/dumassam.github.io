<p style="width:700px;" align="justify"">Since 2022, I have worked closely with Dr. Camelia Karimianpour (Course Coordinator) to integrate standard-based grading approaches in the course MAT188 - Linear Algebra for Engineers, at the University of Toronto. The primary objective of this work was to develop LaTeX packages to store a database of mathematical theorems, learning standards, and questions which could later be pulled to create course documents. Using these packages, we sought to provide students with Post-Class Essentials (PCEs) and a standard-based grading approach for some course components. Recent efforts within this project have utilized student-collected data to determine the effectiveness of PCEs as a replacement for standard textbooks and the incorporation of standards-based grading. Furthermore, these results were presented by Dr. Geoffrey McGregor, who collaborated with this project, at the Candian Engineering Education Association conference (2024) </p>
