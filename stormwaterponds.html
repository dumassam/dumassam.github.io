<h1>Stormwater Ponds</h1>
<p>This project was supervised by Dr. Donald Jackson of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p style="width:1000px;" align="justify">In May 2023, I received one of six Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Undergraduate Student Research Awards (NSERC USRA) through the department of ecology and evolutionary biology. 
Through this funding, I conducted fieldwork with the Jackson Lab throughout the summer and continued working with Dr. Jackson as part of the full-year research course EEB397.</p>
<p style="width:1000px;" align="justify">Stormwater ponds (SWPs) are an essential infrastructure to modern water management. However, in urban settings, they often double as suitable habitat for species (e.g., fish, birds, and invertebrates). 
Recent findings have supported the notion that even shallow water bodies such as ponds can undergo intense stratification (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10367">CJG Loewen and DA Jackson 2023</a>).
