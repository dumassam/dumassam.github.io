	<h2>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h2>
	<p>My research interests concern the exploration of quantitative methods used within ecological studies. I intend to further derive mathematical applications to explain concepts in ecology using both fieldwork and simulation data. My current work focuses on malaria modeling in the context of pathogen ecology, primarily studying the impact of prey-predator dynamics on vector-borne diseases.</p>
